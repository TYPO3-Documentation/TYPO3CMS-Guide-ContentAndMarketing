What Articles Go Where
======================

TYPO3 has two main websites and act as hubs for distinct target personas. Articles can be suitable for multiple personas, but for simplicity's sake, they usually fit only one of the hubs:

* typo3.com: **Business Hub**
* typo3.org: **Community Hub**

.. tip::

   **Cross-posting on both websites** can happen, but the article itself should be hosted on *only one* of the websites. The other website should *use an external link to the article* and not repeat the content. If uncertain, typo3.com targets higher levels of the funnel, so it's usually the best place to host cross-posted articles.
