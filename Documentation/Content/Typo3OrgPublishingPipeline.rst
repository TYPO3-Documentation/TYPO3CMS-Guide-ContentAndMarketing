typo3.org Publishing Pipeline
=============================

.. _t3o-pipeline-responsible:

Who is responsible?
===================

The publishing pipeline is managed by the `TYPO3 Content Group <https://typo3.org/community/teams/content>`__.


.. _t3o-pipeline-trello:

Location â€” Trello board
=======================

The publishing pipeline for news and events on typo3.org is maintained on a `public Trello board <https://trello.com/b/QrnBfQyK/typo3-content-this-is-a-public-board>`__.


.. _t3o-pipeline-stages:

Pipeline stages
===============

The pipeline has eight stages (aka. swim lanes):

.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-content-requests:

Content requests
----------------

New content requests submitted through the `Content Request Form <https://typo3.org/community/teams/communication-coordination/content-request>`__ land in this swim lane.

Cards in this swim lane are unprocessed by the `TYPO3 Content Group <https://typo3.org/community/teams/content>`__.

.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-in-progress:

Content in progress
-------------------

This swim lane holds Trello cards for content that is still being written.


.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-needs-review:

Needs review or proofreading
----------------------------

Trello cards move into this swim lane when the content they represent has been written and is ready for review and proofreading. The Content Group will pick up cards and assign a proofreader.


.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-returned-to-author:

Reviewed and returned to author
-------------------------------

When an article has been proofread, the Trello card representing it is moved into this swim lane. The author is notified by the proofreader and asked to review changes and suggestions.


.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-ready:

Ready to publish
----------------

Once an article's author has reviewed and approved an article for publication, the Trello card representing it is moved into this swim lane. Cards in this lane can be published at typo3.org.

Articles in this swim lane usually have an assigned publication date (indicated by the Trello card's deadline field). The Content Group is responsible for assigning publication dates.


.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-published:

Published and ready for next newsletter
---------------------------------------

After an article or event has been published on typo3.org, the Trello card representing it is moved into this swim lane. The *Published URL* information in the description is updated and the deadline is set to completed.


.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-in-newsletter:

Already published in newsletter
-------------------------------

Once an article has been included in a published newsletter, the Trello card representing it is moved into this swim lane. The card will automatically be archived and disappear from view.

.. _t3o-pipeline-stages-blocked:

Blocked
-------

Trello cards representing articles and events, whose progress is somehow blocked, are manually moved into this swim lane.


.. _t3o-pipeline-labels

Labels
======

Within the Trello board, labels are used to indicate how the news articles or events should be treated.

Labels can be combined, as far as it makes sense.

The labels are listed in the order they have in Trello.
